"""
Sharded archive storage helpers (memory-evidence-rfc §3.5.4).

Both `memory.reflection` and `memory.persona` archive entries into per-day
shard files under a directory like ``memory/<char>/<kind>_archive/``. To
keep symmetry (CLAUDE.md "对偶性是硬性要求"), the sharding logic lives in
this single module — both managers just declare which directory and call
in.

File naming: ``<YYYY-MM-DD>_<uuid8>.json`` where the date is the archival
date (local-clock) and ``<uuid8>`` is the first 8 hex chars of a uuid4.
A new shard is created when today's most recent shard already has
``ARCHIVE_FILE_MAX_ENTRIES`` entries (RFC §3.5.4).

Migration helper (`migrate_flat_archive_to_shards`) is reused for the
one-shot migration of legacy ``reflections_archive.json`` (RFC §3.5.5).
Persona has no legacy flat file but the helper is generic so any future
consumer can call it.

All public helpers are async-first; callers provide sync paths via
``asyncio.to_thread`` if they need a sync twin (we don't expose one
because the only callers — the periodic archive sweep loop and the
one-shot startup migration — are async).

    Returns ``(migrated, entries_count, shards_written)``.

    Idempotency:
      - If the migration sentinel file already exists in `archive_dir`,
        returns ``(False, 0, 0)`` immediately.
      - If `flat_path` does not exist, also returns ``(False, 0, 0)`` —
        nothing to migrate.

    Failure semantics:
      If shard writes succeed for some but not all groups (e.g. disk
      full mid-way), this raises so the caller can leave the flat file
      intact as fallback (RFC §3.5.5: "迁移失败 → 保留 flat 文件
      fallback"). Successful writes accumulate; partial state is
      recoverable on next boot since the flat file remains and the
      sentinel is only written after success.
