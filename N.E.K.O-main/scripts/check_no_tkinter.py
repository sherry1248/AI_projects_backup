"""Static check: forbid `tkinter` (and submodules) anywhere in the repo.

Why this exists — architecture rule
-----------------------------------
**This codebase is split frontend / backend, and all GUI operations
belong on the frontend.** The Python side (FastAPI + uvicorn + asyncio)
is a headless service: it serves HTTP, talks to LLMs, manages state,
runs background workers. It does NOT open windows, render dialogs, or
own a Tcl/Tk event loop. Anything the user clicks, drags, or sees lives
in the Electron main/renderer process (Node.js / Chromium) — directory
pickers via Electron's `dialog.showOpenDialog`, screenshot framing via
`desktopCapturer` + a renderer-side overlay, app chrome via the
existing HTML/React UI.

`tkinter` is the canonical violation of that split. Every time someone
reaches for it, they're putting a UI widget toolkit into the backend,
which:

1. Wires a Tcl/Tk event loop into a process that is supposed to be
   request-driven and async. The two loops fight; you end up with
   threading hacks, focus glitches, "why is my window behind
   everything", and `mainloop()` calls inside FastAPI handlers.
2. Couples backend behaviour to the user's local display server. The
   backend stops being relocatable — it can't run remotely (envisioned
   by `NEKO_ACTIVITY_TRACKER_REMOTE`), can't run headless under
   Docker/CI without a virtual framebuffer, and can't be exercised by
   ordinary HTTP integration tests.
3. Drags Tcl/Tk into the packaged dist (tens of MB of runtime + DLLs).
4. Crashes the WHOLE app under Nuitka. Concrete past incident: PR
   #1014's Windows `_run_windows_interactive_screenshot` opened a
   tk overlay for screenshot region selection. Nuitka builds without
   ``--enable-plugin=tk-inter`` (the default) make ``tkinter.__init__``
   raise ``SystemExit("Nuitka: Need to use '--enable-plugin=tk-inter'
   option…")`` on the first ``tk.Tk()`` call. ``SystemExit`` inherits
   from ``BaseException`` not ``Exception``, so the request handler's
   ``try/except Exception`` doesn't contain it — it escaped the asyncio
   worker thread, killed uvicorn, and Electron tore down with its dead
   Python child. End-user symptom: press the screenshot button, the
   entire app closes.

The fix is not "wrap it in `except BaseException`". The fix is "the
backend should never have been opening a window in the first place".
That's what this lint enforces.

What goes where (rule of thumb)
-------------------------------
* **Directory / file pickers** → Electron's `dialog` module (renderer
  → main IPC). For non-Electron contexts (raw `index.html` in browser,
  CLI scripts) fall back to the platform-native bridges already in
  `main_routers/storage_location_router.py`: PowerShell on Windows,
  osascript on macOS, zenity/kdialog/yad on Linux. None of those open
  Tk; they shell out to the OS dialog. If the native bridge fails,
  surface `_DirectoryPickerUnavailable` to the frontend and let the
  user type the path manually — do NOT add a "tk fallback".
* **Screenshot region selection** → Electron's `desktopCapturer` plus a
  transparent BrowserWindow overlay in the renderer. Code path is
  already in `static/app-buttons.js::captureDesktopRegionDirectly`.
* **Status notifications, error dialogs, confirmation modals** →
  existing React/HTML UI in the renderer. The backend reports state via
  HTTP/WebSocket; the frontend renders it.
* **Anything else GUI** → frontend.

What it flags
-------------
Any of the following at module scope, function scope, or inside ``if``
/ ``try`` blocks (the AST walker descends everywhere):

    import tkinter
    import tkinter.filedialog
    import tkinter as tk
    from tkinter import filedialog
    from tkinter.ttk import Frame
    from tkinter import Tk as Root

Comments, docstrings, and string literals mentioning the name are NOT
flagged — only real ``import`` statements. That keeps kill-warning
comments ("don't add tkinter back") legal.

Suppression
-----------
None. The architecture rule is the whole point — a per-line escape
hatch would let "just this once" creep back in. If you genuinely need
tkinter (you almost certainly don't), delete this script in the same
PR and justify in the description why this particular GUI operation
must live in the Python process instead of the Electron renderer.

Output
------
Every violation prints as ``path:line:col  NO_TKINTER  message``. Exit
status is 1 when any violation is found, 0 otherwise.
